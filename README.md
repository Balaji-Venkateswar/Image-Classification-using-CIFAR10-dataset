# Image-Classification-using-CIFAR10-dataset
The project focuses on image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 samples of 32x32 pixel images across 10 classes. The implementation leverages dataloaders and a YAML configuration setup, with utility files organized in a separate folder and imported into the main code. The model architecture includes convolutional and linear layers, and Data and results visualization were conducted using the Matplotlib library.
